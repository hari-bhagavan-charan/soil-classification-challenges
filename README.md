Soil classification challenges using ML



# Soil Type Classification Projects (TensorFlow & PyTorch)

This repository contains two independent implementations of soil image classification using deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## üì¶ Projects Overview

1. **TensorFlow-based Model (`part2`)**
   - Uses a custom CNN model.
   - Implemented with Keras.
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score.
   - Output: `submission.csv` with predicted labels.

2. **PyTorch-based Model (`untitled16`)**
   - Uses transfer learning with ResNet18.
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score.
   - Optimized with Adam optimizer.
   - Output: `submission.csv` for test images.

## üìÅ Common Dataset Structure

- `train/`: Training images.
- `test/`: Test images.
- `train_labels.csv`: Filenames and labels.
- `test_ids.csv`: Filenames for predictions.
